When I launched Norskins in January 2023, I never imagined it would become Norway’s leading cash-out service for the hugely popular game, Counter-Strike 2. What began as a simple experiment quickly grew into a platform with over 2,000 active users and a staggering 10 million kroner in revenue.

My initial mindset was straightforward: create something simple, see how it performs, and then decide if it’s worth expanding. Little did I know that this "just-for-fun" project would turn into something much bigger than I ever anticipated.

## A Bumpy Road to Success

The journey wasn’t without its hurdles. Shortly after launching, Norskins began to gain traction—largely due to word of mouth on Facebook. The rapid growth was exhilarating, but it didn’t take long for the first major challenge to hit us like a bolt out of the blue.

Our business model relied heavily on banks and APIs from various payment services to process payments for our users. But just as we were hitting our stride, some banks froze our accounts, demanding additional documentation before they’d allow us to proceed. This was a massive roadblock, and suddenly, our smooth sailing turned into a scramble for alternative solutions.

While it was frustrating to have our progress temporarily halted, this challenge taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of contingency planning. We had to think on our feet, finding new ways to keep the platform running while we worked through the bank issues. In the end, we came out stronger and more prepared for the future.

## Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead

Despite the setbacks, Norskins proved to be a success, both financially and as a learning experience. I’ve gained a wealth of knowledge from the challenges we faced, and these lessons will be carried into all my future ventures.

What started as a small, fun project turned into a major player in the Norwegian gaming scene, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved. The experience taught me that even when you face unexpected obstacles, persistence and creativity can lead to success beyond your wildest dreams.

Looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing. Every challenge was an opportunity to grow, and every success, no matter how small, was a step toward building something bigger.

Norskins is more than just a cash-out service; it’s a testament to the power of simple ideas, the importance of perseverance, and the incredible potential that comes from taking a leap of faith.
